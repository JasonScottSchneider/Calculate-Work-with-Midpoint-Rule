# Calculate-Work-with-Midpoint-Rule
<p>This is how to calculate <em>work</em> with the Midpoint Rule from calculus using Python. The term <em>work</em> is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required to perfomr a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a <em>force</em>. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object--for example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the earth's gravity on a ball. If <em>F</em> is measured in newtons and <em>d</em> in meters, then the unit for <em>W</em> is a newton-meter, which is called a joule (j).</p>
